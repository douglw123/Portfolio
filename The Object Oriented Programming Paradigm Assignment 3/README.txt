This application was created in netbeans version 8. 

This application makes use of the decorator, factory and strategy patterns. The decorator pattern was used to add accessories to vehicles. The strategy pattern was used to affect the cars behaviour with different mutually exclusive options. The factory pattern was used in the instantiation of concrete accessories and vehicles. This application includes Junit testing. Elements that only hold data like enums or basic sub classes were not tested as there isnâ€™t any operations to test. The classes tested were Controller, AccessoryAdder, AccessoryFactory, Accessory, VehicleFactory, and Vehicle.
